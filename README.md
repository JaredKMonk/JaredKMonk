### Hi, I'm Jared! 👋

I'm a developer based out of D'Iberville, Mississippi, skilled with Typescript, React, and GoLang. I've worked in the industry for over 3 years and getting something of a fresh start thanks to Boot.dev, reinforcing my core CS and backend concepts and learning Python in the process. Also a lifelong gamer currently superglued to my Nintendo Switch, and constantly getting new ideas for projects from the games I play.

Formerly a developer for the startups of AgriTech Corp. and Dottid, currently searching for my next adventure!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on React projects to re-establish my portfolio after time away focusing on work in GitLab
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Data Structures via Boot.dev
- 🎮 I'm currently playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses
